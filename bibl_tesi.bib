  abstract = {{Adaptive filtering is a classical branch of digital signal processing
	(DSP). Industrial interest in adaptive filtering grows continuously
	with the increase in computer performance that allows ever more conplex
	algorithms to be run in real-time. Change detection is a type of
	adaptive filtering for non-stationary signals and is also the basic
	tool in fault detection... More and diagnosis. Often considered as
	separate subjects "Adaptive Filtering" and "Change Detection" bridges
	a gap in the literature with a unified treatment of these areas,
	emphasizing that change detection is a natural extension of adaptive
	filters, and adaptive filters are the basic building blocks in all
	change detectors. By providing a timely and innovative resource,
	applied engineers, researchers and postgraduate students studying
	DSP will all find this an indispensable and enlightening read! Presents
	a comprehensive and complete treatment of adapative filtering Provides
	a unifying framework for the theory of change detection based on
	a filtering approach Combines mathematical tools (algebra, calculus,
	statistics) and applications areas (airborne, automotive, communication
	systems, standard signal processing and automatic control applications)
	Features extensive examples and case studies which can be reproduced
	and investigated in an accompanying Matlab demo toolbox.}},
